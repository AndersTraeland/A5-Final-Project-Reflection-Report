## 1. Process of creating the tool 

- The use of BIM is and will definitiely be a big part of the future in the industry. Taking this course has enabled us to learn more about the advantages and challenges regarding BIM. The building industry aims for a paperless workflow where information, competence and data can be shared through open source. We will most definitely be a part of this future, and adressing these matters in a thesis can therefore be of great value. 

- We both believe that it was definitely a positive thing to be given a broad freedom of choice regarding the use cases. Being able to chose from a number of alternatives has enabled us to make a workflow about something that interests us and that we believe will be of value in our future professional life. Choosing freely from a number of use cases makes the course relevant for several different engineering diciplines and makes it possible to cooperate across these diciplines. The overall understanding of BIM is therefore increased. 

- The number of tools in this course were sufficient, but it would be interesting to have a lecture in the early stage completely dedicated to IfcOpenShell in pyhton. This could have given us a head start to creating a tool. It may potentially also have given us time to develop our use case even further and better.

## 2 Output of the tool 

- We identified the use case as cost estimation in the early stage of a process. After having made a worktool that produces the cost of structural elements in an ifc-model we would conclude that our tool adresses this use case. The tool we made was meant to be for contractors in the early stages of a tender, but could defnitely also be used in an early design phase. The use case would perhaps be redefined slightly, but the worktools can be used for both. 

- In our opinion the use case is well modelled. We have created a tool that extracts structural elements from an Ifc-model and creates a cost estimation in an effective and user-friendly way. Based on feedback on our assignment we have have gained an understanding on what aspects that could be implemented in our tool in the future. For instance, making a type of quality control system would be a great addition to the tool. A system like this would give the user an indication on whether or not the results and output of the script is correct and in accordance with the Ifc-model. A visualization of the elements in each floor (for instance through html), together with the price, could work as a type of quality control. The user would then easily see where the different costs are located. 

When working with the project we also looked into the Molio Cost Data from the .json file. We decided that this file didn't fit completely into the way we wanted to develop our tool. The .json-file could however be implemented with a few tweaks in our worktool, if this is concidered beneficial. 

- In order to narrow down the use case to a specific area, we chose to focus on the structural elements in an ifc-model. This made it possible to focus more specifically on the important parts of our code. We quickly realised that we needed to scope the project, and not go too wide when defining the use case. 

## 3. Future 

- The use of OpenBIM tools in our thesis will be strongly considered after taking this course. The reason for this is already mentioned in the first paragraph of section 1. 

- We can almost certainly say that we will either use or encounter OpenBIM tools in future professional life. We believe that the only possible way to avoid OpenBIM during the next 10 years is to chose a completely different line of work...
